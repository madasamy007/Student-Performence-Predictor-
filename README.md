# Student-Performence-Predictor-
This project uses machine learning to forecast student performance. Built with Flask and SQL, the web app analyzes student data (marks, attendance) to identify at-risk students. It provides dashboards for administrators, teachers, and students to view predictions and foster a supportive educational environment.
